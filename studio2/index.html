        <h2>Legion of Honor</h2>
        <p>
            In August 2022, I visited the Guo Pei: Couture Fantasy exhibit at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. It featured over 80 pieces from China's first couturier, Guo Pei. Through a blend of everything from Chinese imperial history to European architecture to Buddhist symbolism, Guo Pei's designs are extravagant pieces that blur the line between fashion, art, and sculpture.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a Chinese Studies, International Relations, and Design triple major, this exhibit had a bit of everything I am interested in. I want to introduce a few pieces that stood out to me and explore their cultural relevance.

                <h2>Blue and White Porcelain</h2>
                <p>Blue and white porcelain is a valuable, coveted type of ceramic ware that is traditionally decorated with blue cobalt pigment on a white porcelain base. It gained popularity around the 14th hundreds and quickly spread to other nations. </p>

                <p>
                    Guo Pei reimagined the blue and white porcelain as dresses, which were revealed in her 1002 Nights collection in 2010.

                <p>
                    The dress shown on the right includes a porcelain vase as a headpiece. The vase is inside a crystal-encrusted, fan-shaped pane, whose zigzag pattern is reminiscent of the cracks of broken ice, common in ceramic glazes of the Song dynasty.
