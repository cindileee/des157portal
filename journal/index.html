        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Form design is one of the key task for a product designer to create simple forms that convert. In the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"> "Best practices for form design"</a> by Salim Ansari, Ansari shares that a good form design must do the following: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>only ask relevant questions</li>
            <li>be in the one column format</li>
            <li>reduce cognitive load by breaking up into multiple steps</li>
            <li>ask simple questions first</li>
            <li>distinguish between optional and required fields</li>
            <li>explain and show the format requirements</li>
            <li>Include lables that are always visible</li>
            <li>Include placeholder text that are always visible</li>
            <li>Adaptive size fields</li>
            <li>Be careful with default values</li>
            <li>Auto focus first input fields</li>
            <li>Minimize the use of dropdown menus and use radio buttons or checkboxes instead</li>
            <li>Making a form tab ready</li>
            <li>Provide matching keyboard</li>
            <li>Explain the need for asking certain sensitive questions</li>
            <li>Provide show password option</li>
            <li>Have clear, effective action buttons</li>
            <li>Never include a reset or clear button because it might accidentally delete their whole form</li>
            <li>Create accessible forms through proper color contrast, ability to control text size, enable screen reader, and don't rely on color as the only visual means to communicate</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Reading this article made me realize how important everythiing single detail is to creating a seemingly simple form. It really goes to show that good UX design is invisibile because I never noticed these differences until they have been pointed out. It also makes me reflect on forms that I designed and how I can improve upon them in the future.

        <h2>Example of Good Form Design</h2>
        <p>
            One example of a well designed form is the <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount%3Fnc%3D1&dsh=S-519627252%3A1634516012974149&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp">Google Account Sign Up Form</a>. It is super short and only asks for five things. The placeholder text shifts to the top to remain visible when the user begins filling out the field to ensure they always know what information they need to input. For the email field, they include a short description of values they can use. For the password field, they include requirements that can always be seen below the field and there is a show password option. The action button is also clear and visible.
