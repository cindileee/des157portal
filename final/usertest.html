    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The hot spots were a bit hard to navigate as they overlapped at times.</li>
        <li>Some of the smaller hotpots were hard to find.</li>
        <li>Testers really liked the "Legion of Honor" section.</li>
        <li>When on a different device with different screen dimensions, the format was off.</li>
        <li>The speed at which my slideshow moved could be improved.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Plans on Implementation</h3>
    <p>
        After conducting the usability tests, I received a lot of great feedback on areas for improvement. First and foremost, I will make sure that when resized, my site still looks how I wwant it to look. I do not have plans to make it mobile responsive but at the very least, it should work on all desktops regardless of size. Next, I will focus my attention on improving my zoom on hover section, which is the area that most of my testers had difficulty navigating. I might go back and iterate ways to better highlight my different hotspots since locating them was a major pain point for my users. The way it zoomed in and the location and size of my hotspots also needs to be polished. The site that I tested was also incomplete as I had not yet added all the overlays, so I will also work on that.
