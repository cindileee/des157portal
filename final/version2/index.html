            <h2>Legion of Honor</h2>
            <p>
                In August 2022, I visited the Guo Pei: Couture Fantasy exhibit at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. It featured over 80 pieces from China's first couturier, Guo Pei. Through a blend of everything from Chinese imperial history to European architecture to Buddhist symbolism, Guo Pei's designs are extravagant pieces that blur the line between fashion, art, and sculpture.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                As a Chinese Studies, International Relations, and Design triple major, this exhibit had a bit of everything I am interested in. I want to introduce a few pieces that stood out to me and explore their cultural relevance.

                    Guo Pei reimagined the blue and white porcelain as dresses, which were revealed in her 1002 Nights collection in 2010.

                    The dress shown on the right includes a porcelain vase as a headpiece. The vase is inside a crystal-encrusted, fan-shaped pane, whose zigzag pattern is reminiscent of the cracks of broken ice, common in ceramic glazes of the Song dynasty.
